            <P>If we examine the past year's events in Iraq as one important 
            dimension of the United States' post-9/11 strategy in the Middle 
            East, it seems clear that, on balance, Israel has benefited. But 
            this might not continue for long to be the case. 
            <P>True, the US occupation of Iraq did not bring about the much 
            ballyhooed positive domino effect of peace and democratization in 
            the region. Yet on balance, and to date, America's actions in the 
            region over the past two and a half years have been good for Israel. 
            They have eliminated any vestige of a coordinated Arab military 
            threat ("eastern front") against Israel, begun to roll back the 
            weapons of mass destruction threat (Libya, hopefully Iran, 
            Pakistan's proliferation mania), and provided Israel with a powerful 
            ally in its struggle against the Islamic radical movements that 
            target it. 
            <P>After 9/11 Israel joined the "good guys", while Yasser Arafat 
            maneuvered himself into the ranks of the "evil ones", along with 
            Saddam Hussein. Even the uglier aspects of the American war on 
            terror-regrettable civilian casualties and damage in Iraq, the 
            daunting specter of the Guantanamo detention facility, and the 
            recent revelations regarding American and British torture of 
            prisoners-reflect favorably on Israel, by demonstrating to its 
            critics in the West that its treatment of Palestinians in wartime, 
            however problematic, is probably more humane than the "dirty war" 
            norms of what other civilized countries end up doing as they fight 
            back against terrorism. 
            <P>At the grand strategic level, the American offensives in 
            Afghanistan and Iraq and against al Qaeda are predicated on a notion 
            that is very welcome in Israel: that the real Middle East dynamic 
            around which US policy should be organized is not the Israel-Arab or 
            Israeli-Palestinian dispute, but rather the need to counter Islamic 
            terror, WMD, and radical rogue states, all of which directly 
            threaten American security. 
            <P>Those who now argue that "Iraq = Palestine", that in both 
            countries Arab freedom fighters are struggling against imperialists 
            and colonialists, hold that, in effect, there are no Middle East 
            solutions-no peace, no democracy and human rights, no prosperity, no 
            stability-without a Palestinian solution. That is what moderate Arab 
            countries like Egypt and Jordan told the Bush administration before 
            the invasion of Iraq. 
            <P>In is now clear that US President Bush barely paid lip service to 
            this notion. He adopted the roadmap prior to the war to help out 
            British Prime Minister Tony Blair politically, and made a mild 
            effort to "launch" it shortly after the occupation of Iraq was 
            completed. But the administration's heart was never really in this 
            enterprise. It assessed, with some degree of accuracy, that the 
            moderate Arab states with their concern over Palestine were nothing 
            but "paper tigers" in the Iraqi context. What became important for 
            Washington was installing a stable and friendly regime in Baghdad 
            and, as a consequence, winning the November 2004 election. 
            <P>In this regard, the noble goal of democratization in the Middle 
            East has emerged during the past year as nothing but old-fashioned 
            regime change. Ask Yasser Arafat, whose removal Washington and 
            Jerusalem adamantly demand because he condones terrorism, even 
            though he was elected more democratically than any other Middle East 
            leader. Further, Bush signaled Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon 
            just under a year ago that American electoral and Iraqi concerns 
            require that there be no messy Israeli-Palestinian peace process at 
            all. Bush went out on a limb to embrace Sharon's problematic 
            disengagement plan only on condition that it not take place in 2004 
            and that the preparations provide Washington with "peace" dividends 
            in return for minimal investment; now even that deal has been 
            jeopardized by the negative Likud referendum vote. 
            <P>Despite Israel's improved strategic status, not all of the 
            post-9/11 related developments are good for its long term interests. 
            A vigorous US-sponsored Israeli-Palestinian peace process would 
            certainly be better than the administration's indifference. 
            Meanwhile, even though Iraq really is not Palestine, the veneer is 
            wearing thin on the American grand strategy in the region, and that 
            is definitely bad for Israel. Indeed, the more the American armed 
            forces sink into a violent morass in Iraq and possibly in 
            Afghanistan, lose their deterrent effect and fail to stabilize a 
            single Arab country into which Washington has invested nearly 
            150,000 troops and hundreds of billions of dollars, the worse it is 
            not only for the United States, but for its ally, Israel, as well. 
            <P>If the US now opts to extricate itself from Iraq by adopting more 
            traditional Middle East expedients-Israel may pay a price. In 
            retrospect, the red line may have been crossed with the enthusiastic 
            introduction and endorsement by Washington of a UN special envoy for 
            Iraq, Algeria's Lakhdar Brahimi, for whom Israel is "the big poison" 
            in the Middle East (talk about linkage!), followed by a plan to 
            promote a compromise caretaker commander for Fallujah drawn from the 
            ranks of Saddam's most trusted generals. <I>-Published

            <P>Whether the people of Palestine, Iraq or elsewhere like it or 
            not, the perception in the region is that Iraq and Palestine are 
            linked. Palestinians in general would prefer to say that their cause 
            is different because they are rejecting an illegal occupation 
            through a resistance that stands in harmony with international 
            standards. But the fact that these two areas are at war and both are 
            causes that enjoy great sympathy and popularity links the issues in 
            the eyes of the region's publics. 
            <P>Ironically, it is supporters of Israel that are most avid in 
            trying to create connections between these two tragic situations. 
            Israel, as part and parcel of its attempts to identify with the 
            United States, always attempts to give the impression that its fight 
            with Palestinians is part of any disagreement that the United States 
            has with just about anybody. For example, when the United States 
            launched its war against terrorism, especially the front in 
            Afghanistan immediately after the events of September 11, Israel 
            exerted great efforts in telling the world that Palestine was also 
            part of the same fight. Similarly, Israel does its best to identify 
            with the United States and the war in Iraq. 
            <P>But apart from aggressive attempts to shape the perception of 
            events, the realities themselves and the images flowing from here 
            and there are inviting public opinion in the region to find 
            similarities. The images of heavily armed soldiers raiding homes, 
            frightening civilians, conducting operations that end in heavy 
            civilian casualties, the shelling of populated areas, declaration of 
            curfew and so on all link the two conflicts. 
            <P>On a deeper level of analysis, one observes other connections 
            between the two arenas. The American vision of the future of the 
            Middle East provides Israel with a major regional role and 
            ultimately, hegemony. Such a vision can only materialize when the 
            United States is able to meet certain goals in the region, including 
            accomplishing what it set out to do in Iraq. The failure of the 
            United States to achieve what it wants in Iraq will prevent the 
            American administration from achieving its vision of the "new Middle 
            East." One component of this regional overhaul is a major role for 
            Israel, despite its continuing occupation, which seems certain to 
            come at the expense of the basic rights and political positions of 
            the Palestinian people. 
            <P>On the other hand, there are significant differences in what is 
            going on in the two fronts. The Palestinian problem is not a new 
            issue and is not related to the immediate needs of the United 
            States. It is a long-standing conflict with deep roots and religious 
            and national dimensions. While the Iraqi conflict is fierce and 
            carries heavy losses, it does not have the same complicated burdens 
            of religion and history. 
            <P>Having said that, perhaps the most significant similarity is that 
            neither conflict will see significant progress as long as the 
            parties follow the approach of resorting to force and physical 
            power, rather than international legality. If international bodies 
            such as the United Nations are given a chance to play a role in the 
            solution, then we may see a decline in the suffering, and a return 
            to the hope of constructive peace negotiations, and finally a return 
            to security and peace. <I>-Published 3/5/2004(c)bitterlemons.org

            political debate in the Middle East and beyond has been the argument 
            that the conflicts in Iraq and in Palestine are essentially similar, 
            that they are closely linked together, influence one another and are 
            but one struggle fought on two fronts. 
            <P>The claim that Iraq and Palestine are interlinked was invoked in 
            the past by Iraqis seeking to capitalize on the Arab commitment to 
            Palestine in advancing Iraqi interests. One recalls Saddam Hussein's 
            attempt in 1990 to mobilize Arab popular support for his plans for 
            Kuwait, claiming that Iraq's struggle for Kuwait was part of the 
            Arab struggle to liberate Palestine, and receiving an enthusiastic 
            ovation from Yasser Arafat. Later on Saddam bought Iraq's shares in 
            the Palestinian struggle by subsidizing families of suicide bombers. 
            Nowadays Muqtada al-Sadr is the most outspoken Iraqi figure 
            endorsing Hamas (as well as Hizbullah). 
            <P>Stories about American-Israeli cooperation in counterinsurgency, 
            including guided tours presumably conducted by Israeli officers for 
            their American opposite numbers in the Jenin refugee camp, are 
            quoted by proponents of the linkage argument. Analysts offer a 
            variety of ways by which the two conflicts influence each other or 
            are expected to do so. 
            <P>Thus it is suggested that as the insurgency in Iraq gains 
            momentum, it will uplift the morale of its Palestinian counterpart 
            and instill in it increased drive and initiative, and the revived 
            Palestine armed struggle will in turn bolster the resolve of the 
            Iraqi insurgency. Moreover, the linkage between the two conflicts is 
            said to have already enhanced the centrality of the Palestine 
            problem: America's difficulties in Iraq, as well as the growing 
            hostility it faces from Arabs and Muslims, are bound to force it to 
            change its attitude and start exerting pressures on Israel. 
            <P>A parallelism has even been found between the people of the 
            besieged Fallujah in Iraq and the Egyptian soldiers trapped in 
            Fallujah and in Iraq al-Manshiyyah in Palestine during the 1948 War, 
            an experience which provided one of them, Gamal Abd al-Nasser, with 
            inspiration for his pan-Arab vision. The view that the two conflicts 
            are linked, and that one cannot be solved without the other, is 
            voiced by realistic and pragmatic political figures and 
            commentators. 
            <P>Yet the two conflicts are not really interlinked. Their 
            respective sources and trajectories are profoundly different. In 
            Iraq the violence is obviously a manifestation of an inter- and 
            intra-communal struggle for power in preparation for the departure 
            of the coalition forces, and fighting against those forces is one of 
            the cards used by competing parties. The conflict in Iraq did not 
            break out as a result of developments in Palestine, and its 
            resolution does not depend on resolving the Palestinian problem. 
            Similarly, were the main parties in Iraq to agree on a formula 
            opening the way for internal peace and departure of coalition 
            forces, would this change the basic positions of Israelis and 
            Palestinians in their conflict, or the balance of power, or the 
            situation on the ground? 
            <P>Furthermore, the two conflicts clearly evolve independently of 
            each other. Jenin has indeed declared itself a twin city with 
            Fallujah (the one in Iraq), yet the siege of Fallujah, and the 
            intensification of the insurgency in Iraq in general, have not been 
            accompanied by a similar intensification of Palestinian operations, 
            at least thus far. Similarly, America's difficulties in Iraq have 
            not forced it to change its policies vis-a-vis Israel, again at 
            least thus far-witness the recent Bush-Sharon understandings. 
            <P>Events in Iraq since March 2003 have only underlined what had 
            been obvious for some time, namely that in real political terms, 
            pan-Arabism exists no longer, and inter-Arab commitment is symbolic 
            rather than real. The struggle of the Palestinians is their own, and 
            its fate will be determined by whatever happens on the ground, and 
            not far afield. 
            <P>Still, Iraq does have implications for the Arab-Israel equation 
            in a wider sense. One is the removal of the potential eastern front 
            threat, following the demise of the Saddam regime. It is difficult 
            to imagine the reemergence of an Iraqi military threat to Israel in 
            the next few years. In hindsight it can be argued that the Iraqi 
            military did not constitute a formidable threat in the first place. 
            Nevertheless it had such an image, and its removal allows the 
            introduction of changes in Israel's strategic and political 
            planning. 
            <P>Secondly, the continued military presence of the United States in 
            Iraq, and its inability thus far to lead the local forces to form a 
            legitimate, effective and stable government, seem to erode its image 
            as the one power capable of setting the Middle Eastern agenda. The 
            longer it stays in Iraq, the harder it will be for the US to revive 
            and lead the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. This serves the 
            interests of neither Palestinians nor Israelis. <I>-Published

            <P><B>bitterlemons:</B> What did you see in your recent trip to Iraq 
            that evoked for you similarities or differences with Palestine? 
            <P><B>Atallah:</B> We were traveling between Baghdad and al Halla 
            and we had to find a bypass road to avoid an area that had been 
            closed by the Americans. We were stuck for more than one hour, and I 
            thought--I even wrote it down--that I didn't see any difference 
            between what was happening here and in Palestine. 
            <P>This put me in the psychological situation of being at home. At 
            times I was frightened, not because the Americans were there, but 
            because I was thinking that they were Israeli soldiers--that 
            impression was living inside of me. 
            <P>There were checkpoints and bypass roads and requests for IDs. But 
            here in Palestine, [the Israelis] are more hi-tech. When you get to 
            a checkpoint, they easily record your ID number and check the 
            computer to see if you are wanted. In Baghdad, the Americans don't 
            have such things. They are a new occupation. 
            <P>Another issue that reminded me of home was the cement walls. 
            <P><B>bitterlemons:</B> The army is building walls? 
            <P><B>Atallah:</B> The walls are closing roads, cutting off 
            entrances to military camps and hotels and ministries, or the way to 
            the airport from Baghdad. Of course, these are not dividing the 
            country, but it does make life difficult. 
            <P><B>bitterlemons:</B> From a political standpoint, what are the 
            comparisons that can be made? 
            <P><B>Atallah:</B> I heard from Iraqi intellectuals about how the 
            Iraqi and Palestinian authorities are similar, in that they are 
            called "authorities", but are not responsible for more than 
            education and health. This was a joke they told. 
            <P>But in truth, the political situations are entirely different. 
            There, we are speaking about "occupation"--even those in the Iraqi 
            council call it an occupation. But there are still some Iraqis who 
            believe that the American occupation is necessary in order to manage 
            the internal divisions. 
            <P>Al Iraqiya television, one of the TV stations founded by the 
            Americans and an official Iraqi channel, speaks of Palestine as an 
            "occupation", but when it talks about Iraq, it talks about the 
            "coalition forces." These people also do not find the two cases 
            similar. They see the Palestinians as having the right to rebel 
            against the Israeli occupation, and the Iraqi resistance as 
            illegitimate. 
            <P><B>bitterlemons:</B> When you spoke with Iraqis about how they 
            see their future, what did they say? Do they sound like 
            Palestinians? 
            <P><B>Atallah:</B> We were there supporting the Iraqi implementation 
            of a large survey about living conditions. We traveled all over 
            Kirkuk, Halqut and Yacouba. The Iraqis say they are unsure about 
            their future. At the beginning of the war, they had a lot of hope, 
            but now they are not sure how things will be. 
            <P>My Iraqi friends said that those of us living in Palestine and 
            Iraq are going to compete with each other for quite a long time over 
            whose situation is worse. But even as they make this comparison, 
            most of them believe that the Iraqi problem will be solved more 
            easily than the Palestinian problem. 
            <P><B>bitterlemons:</B> In your experience, how do Palestinians view 
            Iraq? 
            <P><B>Atallah:</B> A lot of Palestinians make the comparison in the 
            sense that when they watch television, it is hard for them to 
            distinguish [visually] between Iraq and Palestine. But the context 
            is very different. Here in Palestine, we are speaking about daily 
            conflict, not only with Israeli soldiers, but with the Israeli 
            people in the form of settlers, the bypass roads, the fence. 
            <P>I believe that the Iraqi problem is easily solved, when compared 
            with Palestine. Here, on the other hand, we are speaking about 
            another people that want to replace us, not only occupy us. They 
            want our land. There, it is more economic and another kind of 
            political agenda, for which there might be an agreement that you can 
            be happy with. But for Palestinians, any new agreement is 
            difficult--even [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon's proposal was 
            rejected by the Likud. Our issue is much more complicated.
